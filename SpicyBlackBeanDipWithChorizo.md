# Spicy Black Bean Dip with Chorizo

## Ingredients
* 1 tablespoon pure olive oil
* 1/4 lbs bulk pork chorizo
* 1 clove garlic, finely minced
* 1 jalapeno chile, including seeds and ribs, finely minced
* 3/4 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1 can (14.5 oz) diced tomatoes in juice
* 1 can (15 oz) black beans, drained and rinsed
* 2 tablespoons minced fresh oregano
* Kosher salt (optional)
* Freshly ground black pepper (optional)

## Directions
In a large saute pan over medium heat, warm the oil and swirl to coat the pan. Add the chorizo and saute, stirring constantly and using the side of a spatula to break up the chunks, until cooked through, about 3 minutes. Add the onion, garlic, jalapeno, and cumin. Saute until the onion is softened, about 2 minutes longer. Add the tomatoes, including the juice from the can, and simmer until most of the juices evaporate, about 3 minutes longer. Add the beans and fresh oregano. Saute until heated through, 2 minutes longer. Taste for seasoning, and add a little salt and pepper, if desired. Transfer to a warmed serving bowl and serve immediately.

This dip can be prepared up to 1 day in advance. Cool, cover and refrigerate. Reheat in the microwave or in a skillet over low heat just before saving.
