# Fluffy Pancakes

## Ingredients

* 2 egg yolks
* 3 tsp milk
* 7 tsp plain all-purpose flour
* 2 egg whites
* 4 tsp sugar
* 1 tbsp egg white powder
* 1 tsp baking powder
* Baking paper
* Cooking oil spray

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 180C (356F), add empty baking tray to oven to heat up.
2. Whisk together the egg yolks, milk and flour until smooth with no lumps.
3. Beat the egg whites, sugar egg white powder and baking powder until you have stiff peaks.
    * Use an electric mixer; it may take 3-5 minutes.
4. Mix a spoonful of egg whites into the yolks to lighen them.
    * This makes it easier to fold them back without over mixing.
5. Fold the yolks into the whites just until they are combined.
6. Take the hot tray, and cover with baking paper, and spray with cooking oil.
7. Add three ice cream scoops of mixture per pancake, and bake for 2.5 minutes.
    * Save at least one scoop of mixture per pancake.
8. Open the oven, and add one more scoop per pancake. Bake for 5-7 more minutes.
9. Take the tray out, and flip the pancakes. Return to the oven for 4 more minutes.

### Pan Frying

Skip the oven, and just pan fry these like normal pancakes. They don't look as fancy, but taste great.
